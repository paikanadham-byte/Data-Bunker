Visit: https://company.com
Scrape: Contact page, About page
Extract: Phone, Email, Address from HTML
```

**Step 3: Search Extraction (Method 2)** ✅
```
Search: "Company Name Los Angeles phone number"
Result: "Contact us at (555) 123-4567..."
Extract: (555) 123-4567

Search: "Company Name Los Angeles address"  
Result: "Visit us at 123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA 90001"
Extract: 123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA 90001

Search: "Company Name Los Angeles contact"
Result: "Email: info@company.com"
Extract: info@company.com
```

**Step 4: Save to Database**

## 📁 Data Organization

Companies are saved with jurisdiction codes:
- `us_ny` - New York
- `us_ca` - California  
- `us_fl` - Florida
- `us_il` - Illinois
- `us_tx` - Texas
- etc.

### Query by Location
```sql
-- All California companies
SELECT * FROM companies WHERE jurisdiction LIKE 'us_ca';

-- All Texas companies
SELECT * FROM companies WHERE jurisdiction LIKE 'us_tx';

-- Count by state
SELECT jurisdiction, COUNT(*) 
FROM companies 
WHERE jurisdiction LIKE 'us_%' 
GROUP BY jurisdiction;
```
