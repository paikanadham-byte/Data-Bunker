## Recommendation by Use Case

### Choose FREE Web Discovery if:
- 🆓 **Budget**: Zero budget, want to test first
- 🎯 **Targeted**: Need specific industry/location (e.g., "tech in San Francisco")
- 🔄 **Current**: Only want active companies with websites
- 📧 **Contacts**: Priority is email/phone over official records
- 🏃 **Small Scale**: Need 100-500 companies total

### Choose Paid API Import if:
- 💰 **Budget**: Have $30-300/month budget
- 📊 **Volume**: Need thousands of companies quickly
- 🏛️ **Official**: Need official registration numbers
- 📈 **Complete**: Want all companies in a state (active + inactive)
- ⚡ **Speed**: Time-sensitive, need data fast

### Use BOTH:
1. Start with **FREE discovery** to test and build initial database
2. If you need more, upgrade to **API import** later
3. Your data and enrichment workers work the same either way!

# Result: 500 companies, $0 cost
```

### Growth (Months 4-6):
```bash
# Still FREE, expand coverage
# Add more states, industries, cities
# Build to 2,000-3,000 companies

# Result: 3,000 companies, $0 cost
```

### Scale (Month 7+):
```bash
# IF you need 10,000+ companies quickly:
# Upgrade to API ($30-300/month)

# BUT you already have 3,000 companies for free!
# Only pay for incremental growth
```

## Conclusion

**Start with FREE web discovery!**

Why?
- Zero risk
- Test your use case
- Build initial database
- Learn what data you need
- Validate before paying

You can always upgrade to the API later if you need:
- Higher volume (thousands at once)
- Official registration data
- Faster imports

**Both methods work with the same database and UI** - you're not locked in to either approach!
